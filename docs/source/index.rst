Numerical Manufacturing And Design (NuMAD) Tool for Wind Turbine Blades
##################################################################################


The structural design and optimization of wind turbine blades is a
complex task. In many cases it is difficult to find the optimal design
of a turbine blade by hand, or by trial and error, and the software
tools used for such designs are most effective when integrated into
automated optimization and analysis algorithms. A new version of the
software tool `NuMAD (Numerical Manufacturing And Design) <https://github.com/sandialabs/NuMAD>`_ for the design
and modeling of wind turbine blades is developed and described. 

Newly released :ref:`NuMADv3` is structured to be run from a scripting environment
and easily called by optimization processes. 
The previous release, :ref:`NuMADv2`, relied on the use of a graphical
user interface. Modifications were made to the MATLAB-based source code
to decouple the internal functions from the graphical user interface,
and additional functionality was added for convenience in performing
high-fidelity finite element analysis. NuMAD 3.0 has been successfully
implemented for optimization of large, flexible rotor blades, and is
suitable to be made available for public use.
