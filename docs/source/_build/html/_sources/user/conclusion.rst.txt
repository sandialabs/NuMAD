Troubleshooting
===============

NuMAD will repeatedly print a message in the MATLAB command window to the effect of:

.. code-block:: matlabsession

	``Waiting for ANSYS to <`do something`>``
	``Waiting for ANSYS to <`do something`>``
	``Waiting for ANSYS to <`do something`>``

Common things to check are the ANSYS `.err` and `.log` for clues.

Known Issues
============

Trailing Edge Issues

-  There is a need to allow for the existence of a nonzero trailing edge
   thickness. The only way to achieve this in the current release is to
   specify that the airfoil in question is a flatback.

-  Often the element quality is poor at various parts of the trailing
   edge. Possible solutions could be:

   -  Alter airfoil geometry when reading in to make sharp airfoils for
      small trailing edge thicknesses

   -  Incorporate solid elements to represent trailing edge adhesive

Other Issues

-  The placement of the spar cap must never exceed the bounds of the
   spar cap keypoints.

-  ``blade.updateBOM`` fails for an unknown reason if the layer quantity
   increases rather than decreases toward the tip.
