Overview
=======================

`NuMAD (Numerical Manufacturing And Design) <https://github.com/sandialabs/NuMAD>`_ is an
open-source software program written in
`MATLAB <http://www.mathworks.com>`__ which simplifies the process of
creating a three-dimensional model of a wind turbine blade. The tool
manages all blade information including aerodynamic, and material
properties as well as, material placement. The blade information can be
modified by a structural-optimizer in NuMAD or it can be used to run the
other tools below in a stand-alone mode:

-  The `ANSYSÂ® <http://www.ansys.com/>`__ commercial finite element
   package

-  The NWTC codes PreComp,
   `BModes <https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy06osti/39133.pdf>`__, and
   `FAST <https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy06osti/38230.pdf>`__,

-  PLOT3D file format for CFD mesh building

When used in conjunction with these other tools, NuMAD provides
computation of blade cross section properties, various structural
analyses, and estimation of blade aeroelastic instability.
