**ComponentDef Property**,**Property Description**
``group``,"0: blade, 1: first shear web, 2: second shear web, etc."
``materialid``,string such as ``'spar'``
``fabricangle``,material id number from ``blade.materials``
``hpextents``,The extent of the airfoil covered by the component. High pressure side. Eg. ``{‘a’}``    ``{‘b’}``. See Figure 1‑1.
``lpextents``,The extent of the airfoil covered by the component. Low pressure side. Eg. ``{‘a’}``    ``{‘b’}``. See Figure 1‑1.
``cp``,Material thickness distribution along blade span. ``M × 2`` array. First column is nondimension span location where thickness is to be defined. Second column is material thickness [mm].
``imethod``,``'pchip'``
``pinnedends``,Set to ``false`` by default.
