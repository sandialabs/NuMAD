**AirfoilDef Property**,**Property Description**
``name``,User selected character array
``reference``,any header info in file
``coordinates``,profile data in two columns
``c``,Computed by NuAMD.
``camber``,Camber line as a function of x. Distance in percent chord between LP and HP curves. Computed by NuAMD.
``thickness``,Relative thickness as a function of the x coordinate. Values between 0 and 1 where 1 corresponds to maximum thickness. Computed by NuAMD.
``percentthick``,Maximum airfoil thickness as a percentage of chord length [%]
``maxthick``,Scalar values the airfoild thickness as a percentage of chord. Values between 0 and 1.
``tetype``,Three options: ``‘round'`` or ``'sharp'`` or ``'flat'``
``x``,"Horizontal axis of Airfoil shape coordinates Working clockwise starting from the TE to the LE and back to the TE. LE must be at (1,0) and TE at (0,0)."
``y``,"Vertical axis of Airfoil shape coordinates Working clockwise starting from the TE to the LE and back to the TE. LE must be at (1,0) and TE at (0,0)."
