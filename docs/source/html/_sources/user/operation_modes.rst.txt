Modes of Operation
==================


There are two ways to operate NuMAD. You can either use the graphical user interface (GUI) or you can work with something known as a blade object. The former is the main functionality introduced in NuMAD v2.0. The latter is introduced in NuMAD v3.0 and is the main content of this user guide.

NuMAD GUI Mode
-----------------

With the GUI being relatively unchanged, we comment on the GUI mode of operation breifly. After this section, the rest of this User's Guide focuses on the new features. 

The graphical user interface (GUI) can still be accessed the same as it was in prior releases. Refer to the former user manual
(`SAND2012-7028 <https://energy.sandia.gov/wp-content/gallery/uploads/NuMAD_UserGuide_SAND2012f-7028.pdf>`__) for
detailed instructions on how to use the GUI and for step-by-step examples. The examples in the present manual are focused on operating NuMAD with the blade object.
